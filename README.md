# 🌸 Lily Garden

An interactive and elegant web project featuring white lily flowers brought to life with pure CSS animations and 3D transforms.

## 🎨 Features

* **5 Unique Lilies:** Each flower has its own growth height, animation duration, and rotation.
* **Dynamic Growth:** Watch the stems grow vertically before the petals bloom smoothly.
* **Detailed Foliage:** Realistic stem leaves with individual rotations and gradient coloring.
* **Atmospheric Background:** A deep, dark "night-sky" backdrop to make the white lilies pop.
* **Pure CSS Solution:** Built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3. **Zero JavaScript** used for animations.

##  Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/lily-garden.git](https://github.com/yourusername/lily-garden.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the project:**
    Locate the `index.html` file and open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) to see the garden bloom.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `index.html`: Defines the semantic structure of the garden, stems, and flower components.
* `style.css`: Contains all the styling logic, keyframe animations, and 3D perspective settings.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Structured layouts and nested components.
* **CSS3 Animations:** Custom `@keyframes` for staggered growth and blooming effects.
* **CSS Transforms:** Utilized `rotateX`, `perspective`, and `transform-origin` to create a 3D feel.

## 📸 Preview

The project features a staggered animation sequence where stems rise from the bottom of the "garden" and lilies unfold their petals in a 3D space.
